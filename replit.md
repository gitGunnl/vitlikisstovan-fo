## Development Best Practices

### Content Management
- **Single Source of Truth**: All site content and configuration should be centralized in `client/src/content/site.ts` to prevent duplication and inconsistencies
- **No Hard-coded Content**: Components should never contain hard-coded text. Instead, they should import and use data from the site configuration
- **Structured Data**: Content should be organized in logical sections within site.ts (hero, program, cases, etc.) for maintainability
