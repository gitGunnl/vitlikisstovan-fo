# AI for Pedagogues: Less Paperwork, More Play

## *Easy, safe ways to cut daily admin so you spend more time with children*

---

**Who it’s for**

* Frontline pedagogues and early-years staff in the Faroe Islands.  
* Little or no AI experience.  
* Phone-first, low-tech setups.  
* Looking for quick wins you can use today.

**How to read it**

* Think “small, safe steps.”  
* Copy, paste, try them, and keep what works.  
* You stay in charge: always review AI’s output.

**Not for**

* **Replacing your judgment or care.** AI can draft and suggest; you decide and adapt.  
* **Deep theory or tool setup.** No model specs or vendor tutorials here—just simple chat use (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.).  
* **Work that needs personal or sensitive data.** This guide uses anonymous or generic content only unless your employer provides a compliant, approved setup.  
* **High-tech integrations.** We focus on chat prompts and basic copy-paste, not systems integration.

# Be Careful with What You Put In (No PII)

**A Simple Rule: Don't Feed AI Personal Data**

Imagine calling into a radio show. Once you say something, it's out there—anyone tuning in can hear it, and you can’t take it back. AI chat tools often work similarly; once you share information, you lose control over who can access it.

Some workplaces might provide special, secure AI systems approved for handling sensitive information. But unless you're **100% sure** your setup is approved for private data, never share personal details about children or colleagues—like names, addresses, health info, or other confidential information.

You can talk freely about yourself, but protect others’ privacy. There are plenty of helpful ways to use AI—lesson ideas, storytelling, planning activities—without needing to include personal details. If you wouldn’t say it on the radio, don’t type it in.

**What’s Safe to Share:**

* **Generic information**: Examples, stories, or questions that don’t reveal personal details.  
* **Public information**: General knowledge or educational material that doesn’t link to specific individuals.  
* **Anonymized information**: Descriptions like "I have a shy kid" or "I have a very energetic kid" are fine because they don’t give away any personal identifiers.  
* **Fictional or hypothetical examples**: Using made-up scenarios or generic situations can also help keep things safe.

**What’s Not Safe:**

* **Personal information**: Names, contact details, or anything that could directly identify someone.  
* **Sensitive data**: Health records, social security numbers, or any information requiring strict confidentiality.  
* **Anything that can be traced back**: Even if you’re using an example, if it’s too close to real people or could be traced back to them, it’s better to leave it out.

By following these simple guidelines, you help protect privacy and ensure your AI tools are used safely and responsibly.

# 4\) How to Think About AI as a Partner

Think of AI as your helpful, quick-thinking assistant who is always ready to jump in and support you with your daily tasks. Just like any good colleague, the clearer your instructions and context, the better the assistance you'll receive. AI can feel like another person in the room—always ready with a fresh idea—but it's also quite different: it doesn't tire, never gets bored with repetitive questions, and often suggests things you’d never imagine yourself. However, it can also behave unexpectedly: misunderstanding simple instructions, proposing odd or impractical ideas, or missing things we consider obvious. Think of it as a creative but quirky colleague—you'll need to guide it clearly, check its suggestions carefully, and never fully rely on it without your own professional judgment. Remember, you’re still the expert on your classroom, your children, and your daily routines—AI simply helps transform your knowledge and needs into quick, actionable ideas.

You don't need technical expertise to use AI effectively. Just describe your situation in simple, everyday language as if you were explaining it to a colleague. Clearly state your conditions (children's ages, group size, location, available materials, and constraints like weather or time), and let AI provide tailored, realistic solutions. To use this guide, simply copy the provided prompts into your AI chat tool (like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot), adapt as needed, and start using the suggestions right away.

**Tip:** Save a detailed description of your typical classroom setup—like group sizes, common materials, and regular activities—in a note on your phone or computer. Then just paste this description into the beginning of your prompt, and AI will immediately understand your specific situation. This way, you don't have to repeat yourself each time.

## Creative Sparring Partner

AI shines when your familiar routines start feeling stale or you suddenly need fresh, adaptable ideas. It’s like having a creative teammate who instantly provides a range of exciting, manageable activities tailored precisely to your needs. Whether your plans suddenly change or you just need new inspiration, simply give AI your scenario—theme, available resources, children's ages, and specific constraints—and let it offer vibrant, practical options.

**Imagine this scenario:** Heavy rain hits Vestmanna. Your outdoor plans sink, leaving you indoors with twelve lively 3–4-year-olds. Your monthly theme is "Ocean Life," and you have limited space and basic materials like crayons, paper, building blocks, toilet-roll tubes, and soft toys.

---

**Good example prompt (copy/paste this):**

I’m a kindergarten pedagogue in Vestmanna, Faroe Islands. Due to rain, we're indoors today.

\- Children: 12 kids aged 3–4, energetic but easily overstimulated

\- Theme: Ocean Life

\- Materials available: Crayons, paper, blocks, toilet-roll tubes, soft toys

\- Space constraints: Small indoor area only

Also, we're working with these Faroese words today: “alda” (wave), “hvalur” (whale), “fiskur” (fish), and “tara” (seaweed)—could you weave something fun around those as well?

Please ask first if anything is unclear.

**Follow-up Prompts:** If there is anything you don’t like about the idea, just tell the AI exactly what you don’t like, Here are some ideas:

* "Make these activities simpler and quicker to clean."  
    
* "We loved the storytelling activity. Suggest three similar ocean-themed activities."

**More Opportunities for Creative Sparring**

This role doesn’t stop at activity planning—it can breathe new life into almost any part of your day. When the **room energy runs high**, ask it for calmer versions of what you already planned—threading instead of painting, sorting instead of building, or a short story corner to bring the noise down.

If **materials suddenly go missing**, it can swap them instantly—“same idea, new tools”—turning a paint project into a crayon or tape version without breaking the flow.

When **space or staff change**, it can rebuild the plan for a hallway-only setup, an outdoor mini-version, or a one-adult “light mode” schedule that still feels complete.

It even fits into smaller moments—quick **snack-time conversations** that build language, or short **after-trip reflections** where children draw, tell, and remember what they noticed.

The more you experiment, the more it becomes a genuine creative partner—one that keeps your work fresh, flexible, and full of small sparks of joy.

## Safety & Checklist Buddy

AI can serve as your extra set of eyes, quickly scanning your plans to spot anything you might have overlooked or forgotten, reducing the likelihood that important details get missed. It's like having a vigilant colleague who helps improve your solutions, identifies potential oversights, and suggests practical enhancements. Whenever you're facing a decision—whether it's planning an outing, addressing a tricky classroom situation, or responding to an unexpected event—you can briefly describe your approach or solution to AI. It can quickly suggest potential issues you might not have considered, offer ideas for improvement, or gently challenge your thinking to ensure you've covered essential details.

**Imagine this scenario:** You’re taking eighteen 5‑year‑olds to a crowded national running day with three adults. It will be busy and noisy, and you want AI to check a specific thing: your **adults’ “things to bring” list**—both for any **forgotten essentials** and **simple extras** that make the day easier.

---

**Good example prompt (copy/paste this):**

We’re taking 18 five‑year‑olds and 3 adults to a busy national running day. It will be crowded and loud, with changeable weather. **Here is our current adults’ “things to bring” list:**

* 3 high‑vis vests for adults \+ 6 spare child vests  
* Group identifiers: A/B/C lanyards \+ matching stickers  
* Simple wristbands for children with **group letter**  
* Clipboard with route map, pre‑agreed meeting points, and event schedule  
* Small first‑aid kit (plasters, sterile wipes, instant cold pack)  
* Hand wipes \+ sanitizer  
* Rain shells for adults  
* 2 trash bags (for wet gear)  
* Whistles for adults (1 each)  
* Permanent marker \+ duct tape \+ zip‑bags  
* Phone power bank (1–2)  
  Please **review the list** and:  
1. Flag any **crucial items** we may have forgotten,  
2. Suggest a few **nice‑to‑have extras** that reduce chaos, and  
3. Offer **two simple simplification tactics** (e.g., line‑walking method, regroup signals).  
   Keep it short and practical. Please ask first if anything is unclear.

---

**Follow-up Prompts:** If the list feels overwhelming or needs adjusting, clearly specify what changes you’d prefer. Here are some examples:

* "Make the checklist shorter—include only the absolute essentials."  
    
* "Give me a simple indoor backup activity in case of unexpected heavy rain."

**Other ways this "extra eyes" role can support you:**

Think about all the moments when an extra pair of eyes could help:

* Quickly perform a **Plan pre-mortem:** ask for the top 5 things that could go wrong and simple ways to handle them.  
* Test your decision-making with a quick **devil's advocate check:** briefly share your plan and get back 3 thoughtful challenges.  
* Run a quick **inclusion & sensory check:** identify who might feel left out and receive easy adaptations to ensure everyone participates.  
* Get an instant **risk snapshot:** have AI produce a clear Green/Amber/Red summary of key risks with concise reasons.

Integrating this supportive AI companion into your daily routine helps create safer, calmer, and more inclusive environments for everyone involved.

## Parent-Comms Copilot

Being a pedagogue isn't only about keeping children safe, happy, and engaged—it's also about making sure parents feel comfortable, informed, and confident. But at the end of a busy day, finding exactly the right words to clearly explain changes, reassure worried parents, or prepare for sensitive conversations can feel exhausting.

AI can step in here as your calm, clear-headed helper—your trusted colleague who takes your quick notes and transforms them into warm, professional, and reassuring communications. It’s particularly helpful when finding the right tone matters most, whether that's friendly and comforting, clear and calm, or firm and professional. It’s also excellent when preparing for important parent meetings, helping you choose your words carefully, anticipate tricky questions, and practice clear and respectful responses.

Your part in this teamwork is simple: you provide the facts, context, and intention—what happened, what’s changing, or what families need to know. The AI takes that and drafts the message or meeting outline for you. But you remain fully in control. You decide what goes in, what stays out, and how it finally sounds. Think of the AI as your writing assistant, not your voice.

And because Faroese is still a developing language for most AI tools, always treat the Faroese text as a **first draft**, not a finished version. Read it aloud, adjust the phrasing, and make sure it sounds natural and kind. That final touch from you is what keeps the message personal, trustworthy, and true to your way of communicating with parents.

**Imagine this scenario:**  
A strong gale warning pops up unexpectedly in Tórshavn, and you realize you’ll need to ask parents to pick up their kids earlier today if they can. You know this sudden change can make some parents anxious or stressed, and you want to quickly send out a reassuring, clear message. At the same time, you’d like to prepare yourself for a few sensitive phone calls and maybe even a quick parent meeting later.

---

**Good example prompt (copy/paste):**

*I’m a kindergarten pedagogue in Tórshavn (Faroe Islands).* A gale warning is expected this afternoon. We want to ask parents: If possible, please pick up by **14:30**. We remain open for families who cannot come early.

**Plan B:** Calm indoor activity stations; normal staff-to-child ratios; safety first.

**Facts to include:**

* Date: \[DD MMM 2025\]  
    
* Groups: A/B/C (no names)  
    
* Pickup times: Early pickup request (14:30) if possible, otherwise normal closing  
    
* Contact: \[phone number/email/Messenger channel\]  
    
  **Please write clearly and simply:**  
    
1. **Parent Note:** A warm, reassuring message (100–120 words) in **Faroese first, then English and Ukrainian**.  
2. **Short SMS:** Two-line reminder in Faroese, English and Ukrainian.  
3. **Tiny FAQ (3 questions):**  
   * "What if we can’t come early?"  
   * "Why is picking up early safer?"  
   * "Do times change tomorrow?"  
4. **Phone Phrasebook:** Six friendly yet clear sentences I can use for quick calls with worried parents.  
   **Writing style:** Plain language, short sentences, calm, reassuring, and respectful.

Ask me if anything feels unclear before you start writing.

---

**Easy follow-up prompts (if the AI’s first draft isn’t quite right):**

Just copy/paste one of these follow-ups to quickly refine the message if you need changes:

* “Make the parent note shorter (\~80 words), but keep the friendly tone.”  
    
* “Change the tone slightly more professional for the SMS.”  
    
* “Add one reassuring line to explain clearly why leaving early is safest.”  
    
* “Make the phrasebook sentences shorter and simpler for phone use.”  
    
* “Include a Danish translation too.”  
    
* “Turn the FAQ into very short, friendly answers.”

---

**Other practical ways to use this role:**

This friendly copilot isn't just for daily updates—it can help simplify and support you in many communication situations, such as:

* Drafting **weekly newsletter updates** or short parent reminders.  
    
* Creating quick, clear **FAQs** before outings or special events, anticipating questions like “What gear is needed?” or “What time is pick-up?”  
    
* Preparing **welcome notes** for new families, clearly explaining routines and essentials.  
    
* **Tone check:** turning overly direct or rushed messages into calmer, warmer ones—or vice versa—depending on your need.  
    
* Preparing for sensitive or tricky **parent meetings**, by providing short phrase guides or even mini role-play conversations to practice clear, kind, and professional responses.  
    
* Writing brief **after-meeting summaries**, clearly outlining “what we agreed” in a neutral and respectful manner.

## Story / Game / Image Maker

When you need a quick way to capture children's attention or gently address everyday issues, this AI role becomes your instant creative helper. Imagine having a ready-made storyteller who can swiftly provide short, memorable narratives tailored precisely to your current themes, recent experiences, or behavioral challenges in the group. Whether it's reinforcing positive routines, helping children grasp tricky concepts, or managing classroom dynamics, AI helps you find just the right words or visuals—making the day more fun with no added burden on you.

**Imagine this scenario:**  
Your group of lively 4-year-olds in Klaksvík consistently forgets handwashing after outdoor play. You want a playful, easy-to-remember story that gently reminds them why clean hands matter, integrating local references to make the idea stick.

**Good example prompt (copy/paste this):**

Create a short, playful story (about 1 minute long when read aloud) for my 4-year-olds in Klaksvík to gently remind them why it's important to wash their hands after playing outside.

Please include these Faroese words naturally in the story: “hendur” (hands), “reint” (clean), “bakteriur” (germs), and “spælipláss” (playground).

Make it relatable and engaging by mentioning common outdoor play activities they love, like playing in the sand, climbing, or picking up stones.

Output:

1\) The story (clear and simple).

2\) A short, repeatable phrase or gesture children can practice together at the end of the story.

Please ask first if anything is unclear.

**Follow-up prompts (quick refinements):**

* **“Great now make an image of the characters from the story, create the image in a kids friendly watercolor style.”**  
    
* “Make the story shorter and simpler—about 30 seconds long.”  
    
* “Include a funny talking animal character the children will remember.”  
    
* “Suggest a small gesture we can do every time to reinforce handwashing.”

**Other Practical Ways to Use this Role**

This role isn’t limited to short stories or quick reminders—it’s your versatile classroom assistant, always ready to brighten routines, tackle tricky situations, or enrich your current themes with creative, engaging content.

**Storytelling Made Easy**

Quickly create playful, engaging stories perfectly tailored to your group’s daily life or current themes. These stories help children learn and grow, turning everyday moments into memorable lessons. You might use AI to:

* Welcome a **new child** gently, making them feel included and safe.  
    
* Create playful **puppet-show scripts** that teach problem-solving or social skills.  
    
* Reinforce visits or outings with **“Yesterday’s adventures,”** anchoring learning in familiar local spots like Viðarlundin or the harbor.  
    
* Address tricky behaviors like **shyness, cursing, or small conflicts** through gentle animal or community stories.  
    
* Clearly explain tricky concepts like **fire safety, germs, or weather** in friendly, child-sized language.

**Games and Activities for Every Moment**

AI helps you swiftly plan fun and inclusive activities, especially when the classroom mood or dynamics shift suddenly. You can use AI to:

* Suggest instant **movement games**, like mimicking local animals ("fly like a puffin" or "jump like a lamb"), perfect for transitions or energy bursts.  
    
* Generate **board games or group activities** on-the-spot, tailored to both shy and energetic kids, ensuring every child feels included.  
    
* Invent quick, playful activities for smaller moments, such as language-building games during snack time or waiting periods.

**Instant Visuals and Posters**

AI can also serve as your classroom illustrator, instantly creating charming visuals to brighten your learning environment. Use AI to:

## Paperwork & Handover Scribe

Being a pedagogue means spending your days focused on children, but the required paperwork and documentation tasks—daily logs, incident reports, development portfolios, and staff handovers—often stretch into your personal time. You might find yourself rushing these tasks during nap times, squeezing them into short breaks, or doing them late in the evening, leaving you feeling that you're never quite done.

AI can step in here as your organized, always-ready assistant, transforming rough notes, voice memos, or bullet lists into clean, structured documents ready to paste directly into your existing forms or logs. It’s like having a precise and reliable colleague who turns quick observations into well-structured text, helping you stay compliant and organized without losing precious time from your day.

Your part in this teamwork is simple: quickly jot down or dictate short notes throughout the day, capturing key details—without using personal identifiers or names. The AI then helps turn these notes into clear, neutral, and professional text for your documentation. You remain fully in control: reviewing each draft, adjusting the wording, and deciding exactly how the final version looks and sounds.

And because Faroese is still developing in most AI tools, always treat AI-generated text as a **first draft**, never a finished product. Always read aloud, adjust phrasing to your style, and double-check key facts. This quick, final review ensures the documentation remains accurate, natural, and entirely in your voice.

**Imagine this scenario:**  
It's been a particularly busy day with fewer staff than usual, and you're now facing several tasks at once: writing today's observations, completing an incident report, and preparing a short staff handover note. You only have a few minutes before parents start arriving, and you want clear, concise documentation without rushing or forgetting important details.

---

**Good example prompt (copy/paste):**

*I’m a kindergarten pedagogue in Runavík (Faroe Islands).* Today was busy with fewer staff. I quickly jotted down these notes (**no personal identifiers**):

* **Daily observations:** energetic outdoor play; calmer afternoon; snack went well; minor conflict resolved quickly.  
    
* **Incident:** Small bump at playground (time: 10:15), quick first-aid applied, child fine, parent informed by phone.  
    
* **Handover:** Tomorrow's focus—more structured indoor play; materials—check building blocks; one staff message sent reminding about wet weather gear.

**Please write clearly and simply:**

1. **Daily observation entry:** Two neutral, concise sentences for our daily log, plus one bullet for "What to watch tomorrow."  
     
2. **Incident report:** Short structured text (2–3 lines per section: What happened, Immediate actions, Follow-up) ready to paste into our form, plus a checklist "Missing details to confirm."  
     
3. **Handover note:** Clear end-of-day summary (max five short bullets) to give tomorrow’s team an instant overview.

Use write in natural Faroese. Keep it neutral, factual, and **never include names or personal data**. Please ask first if anything feels unclear.

---

**Easy follow-up prompts (if the AI’s first draft isn’t quite right):**

Copy/paste one of these to quickly refine your draft:

* “Make the daily observations simpler and shorter (just one sentence).”  
    
* “I want to expand the incident report slightly— ask me a few questions to gather more detail on immediate actions.”  
    
* “Add a clear reminder to double-check materials in the handover note.”  
    
* “Make the tone more neutral and less formal overall.”  
    
* “Add a quick staff reminder about noise levels.”

---

This dependable scribe isn't limited to daily logs or incident reports—it can streamline and simplify numerous documentation tasks, helping you reduce after-hours work and stay organized even on busy days:

* **Quickly shaping structured, form-ready incident reports** from just a few brief notes, ensuring you document clearly and consistently even when you're pressed for time.

* **Turning weekly wrap-up notes into a short, manageable habit**, letting you capture highlights and gentle concerns in minutes rather than hours—giving you back your weekend evenings.

* **Easily crafting meaningful portfolio summaries**, connecting your quick observations directly to developmental milestones and generating simple next-step ideas, so periodic assessments feel natural and doable.

* **Effortlessly preparing clear, one-page handover notes for substitutes or new staff**, making sure everyone stays on track during unexpected changes, without adding extra meetings or stress.
