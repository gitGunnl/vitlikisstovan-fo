The core problem: prerendered HTML likely isn't being served
The prerender system itself is working correctly — I built it locally and verified each route gets its own unique HTML. The issue is almost certainly in how the app is deployed.

1. Check if the build step actually runs during deployment
The build command must be:

npm run build

which runs three steps in sequence:

vite build && node scripts/prerender-seo.js && esbuild server/index.ts ...

Verify: After a deploy, does dist/public/contact/index.html exist on the server? If not, the prerender script didn't run. If only dist/public/index.html exists (no subdirectories like contact/, blog/, podcast/), then vite build ran but prerender-seo.js failed or was skipped.

2. Check if the app starts in production mode
The start command must be:

npm start

which runs NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js.

Verify: Check the value of NODE_ENV on the running server. If it's not production, the server spawns a Vite dev server instead of the Express static file server — and Vite serves the same client/index.html (with homepage content) for every route. This alone would explain every symptom reported.

On Replit, look at the Run command configuration — it should be npm run build && npm start, not npm run dev.

3. Check the dist/public directory structure
After a successful build, it should look like:

dist/public/
├── index.html              ← homepage
├── sitemap.xml             ← generated sitemap
├── robots.txt              ← copied from client/public/
├── llms.txt                ← copied from client/public/
├── llm.md                  ← copied from client/public/
├── contact/index.html      ← contact-specific HTML
├── blog/index.html         ← blog listing HTML
├── blog/vitliki-i-foroyum/index.html
├── podcast/index.html
├── um-okkum/index.html
├── okkara-taenastur/index.html
├── ai-guide/index.html
├── user-guides/index.html
└── ... (17 total HTML files)

If the subdirectories don't exist, the prerender step failed.

4. Quick smoke test after fixing
Once the deploy is correct, run:

curl -s https://vitlikisstovan.fo/contact | grep '<h1>'

Should return <h1>Samband</h1> (the contact page heading)
If it returns <h1>Vitlíkisstovan - Praktisk vitlíkisvenjing... — still serving homepage content
Do the same for /blog (should show <h1>Bloggur</h1>) and /podcast (should show <h1>Podkast</h1>).

5. Verify robots.txt and sitemap.xml are served
curl -s https://vitlikisstovan.fo/robots.txt
curl -s https://vitlikisstovan.fo/sitemap.xml | head -10

robots.txt is a static file copied from client/public/ by Vite. sitemap.xml is generated by the prerender script. If either is missing/broken, it confirms the build didn't complete.

TL;DR: The most likely single root cause is the deployment running in dev mode (npm run dev) instead of building and starting in production (npm run build && npm start). Fixing that one thing should resolve all the reported issues at once.
