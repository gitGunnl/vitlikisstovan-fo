### Prompt — Add Hero Background Image & Enhance Readability

**Asset & size**

* Move the hero-background.webp to the right folder and then use it
* Use the background image file (current size **1589 × 802**).

**Where**

* Apply as the **background of `section#hero`** on the landing page.

**Background behavior**

* Cover the viewport: background should **fill** (`cover`) without distortion, **centered**, and responsive on all breakpoints.
* Section height: **min-height 70–80vh** desktop, **60–70vh** mobile.
* No parallax or heavy effects—keep it light and fast.

**Readability & aesthetics**

* Add a **subtle readability overlay** on top of the image:

  * Primary: a **dark gradient** (e.g., left-to-right or top-to-bottom) with \~**40–55%** opacity so white text meets **WCAG 4.5:1** contrast.
  * Optional radial vignette to soften edges.
* Ensure hero **text remains white** (or very light) with a **subtle text-shadow** for extra legibility.
* Add a tasteful **“watercolor-style frame”** around the hero content block:

  * Implement as a lightweight **CSS mask / SVG filter / border-image**—no heavy libraries.
  * Soft, organic edge that echoes watercolor paper; keep it **very subtle**.
  * **Graceful fallback**: simple rounded border with semi-transparent white if masks/filters aren’t supported.
* Provide an optional **glass panel** style (low-alpha dark or light background with small backdrop-blur) behind the text group; enable it only if needed to pass contrast on very bright screens.

**Layout**

* Keep hero content in a **max-width container** (e.g., \~640–720px) with comfortable padding and spacing for headline, subtitle, and the two CTAs already defined in config.
* Preserve anchor links to `#contact` (primary) and `#program` (secondary).

**Performance**

* Compress `hero-background.webp` to keep it **well under 500 KB**.
* Implement **responsive loading** if your image component supports it (e.g., sizes attribute / srcSet). No extra upscales needed—use the provided source as-is.
* Do not block rendering; background loads progressively.

**Accessibility & SEO**

* Verify **color contrast** for the hero headline and body copy against the overlaid background.
* Since it’s a CSS background, **no alt text** is needed; if you expose the image elsewhere, provide a short descriptive alt.
* Keep LCP reasonable; avoid heavy filters or large JS.

**Acceptance criteria**

* `section#hero` renders with `/public/images/hero-background.webp` as the background, **cover + center**, responsive.
* Text and buttons in the hero are **clearly legible** on both light and dark parts of the image.
* Watercolor-style border is present (or the graceful fallback) and does **not** impact layout performance.
* No layout shift; CTAs still link to `#contact` and `#program`.
* Lighthouse a11y passes for hero text contrast.
